  On 24 January 1983, I was born in a *Dalit* family in Haryana, India. I grew up in Delhi with my three sisters, mom and dad.
  
  In 2019, I earned my PhD from the School of Management Studies, University of Hyderabad, India. My thesis "Handmade OK please: A Mixed Methods Study of Urban Indian Craft Consumers" was guided by [Prof. Dr. B. Rajashekhar](https://profbrajashekhar.in/).
  
  I'm an MBA gold medalist from the Pondicherry University. One of my MBA professors, [Dr Babu George](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beingbabu/), inspired me to realise the importance of own thoughts which eventually triggered my interest in research and teaching. I also finished BA in Tourism Studies from IGNOU & BA Hons Russian Studies from JNU. 

  Most of my research work is from the perspective of sustainable consumption. My recent research interests include an interaction between sustainability and discard studies.
  
  I teach data science and research methodology using RStats. Kindly check the website of my course [R for Beginners](https://r4b.netlify.app/). I focus more on understanding and interpretation of the concept than memorising it.
