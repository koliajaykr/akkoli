  *Jai Bhim! Namo Buddhay!*

  On 24 January 1983, I was born in a Dalit family in the *Mewat* region of Haryana, India. Later, we moved to Delhi. I finished my education in Delhi and had a wonderful time with my mom, dad, and three sisters. Sadly, I lost my dad during the second-COVID wave in Delhi. Now, my mom and I live in a small city Wardha.
  
  I am a first generation PhD graduate. My doctoral thesis "Handmade OK please: A Mixed Methods Study of Urban Indian Craft Consumers" was supervised by [Prof. Dr. B. Rajashekhar](https://profbrajashekhar.in/), School of Management Studies, University of Hyderabad, India.
  
  I am a MBA gold medallist from the Pondicherry University. One of my MBA professors, [Dr Babu George](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beingbabu/), inspired me to realise the importance of own thoughts which eventually triggered my interest in research and teaching. I also finished a bachelor degree in tourism studies from IGNOU & another bachelor honours degree in Russian language from JNU.
  
  For three years, I worked as an Assistant Professor in Pune. In April 2022, I joined Nalanda Academy as a full-time data science educator. I teach data science using R statistical language. Kindly check the website of my course [R for Beginners](https://r4b.netlify.app/). My goal is to establish a non-profit school of data science at the Nalanda Academy. As a data science teacher:
  
  - I don't  believe in memorizing the codes,
  - I think education and health-care should be free and fundamental rights of every citizen, and
  - I tell jokes in my class and score zero on coolness. ðŸ˜…

  My research interests include sustainable production and consumption in context of discard studies. My recent research publication is:
  -  Koli, A.K. (2021), "Handmade OK please: key criteria for purchasing craft items by Indian consumers", *Journal of Cultural Heritage Management and Sustainable Development*, Vol. ahead-of-print No. ahead-of-print. https://doi.org/10.1108/JCHMSD-04-2020-0063
