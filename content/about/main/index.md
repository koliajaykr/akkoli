intro: |
  I was born on 24 January 1983 in a *Dalit* family of the Mewat region in Haryana, India. I grew up my with three sisters, mom and dad. My childhood was not that bad.
  
  My schooling was done in Najafgarh and Janak Puri areas of Delhi. 

  I earned my BA in Tourism Studies from [IGNOU](http://ignou.ac.in/), BA Hons Russian Studies from [JNU](https://www.jnu.ac.in/main/), MBA in Tourism (Gold Medalist) from [Pondicherry University](https://www.pondiuni.edu.in/) and PhD in Management Studies from the [University of Hyderabad](https://uohyd.ac.in/).  

  [Dr Babu George](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beingbabu/) - my MBA teacher - helped me to realise the importance of our thoughts. And, this triggered my interest in research and teaching. Thank you Babu sir!
  
  I like to teach research methodology and data science using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) statistical language. Why? Because during my PhD, I found grasping research concepts very daunting. My goal is to reduce the pain of learning research methods. I always focus upon understanding the concept and its interpretation than memorising the equations. 
  
  My research work is often from the perspective of sustainability. Recently, I started to learn and research the interaction between sustainable consumption and waste.

  Till now my students have given me okay feedback. Hence, so far so good.
