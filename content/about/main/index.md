  On 24 January 1983, I was born in a Dalit family in the [Mewat](https://goo.gl/maps/ttCxM7gT7ynwVEMX8) region of Haryana, India. Later, we  moved and settled in Delhi. After living in Pondicherry, Hyderabad, Pune, and Wardha, now I'm again living in Delhi NCR.
  
  I finished my secondary education from [KMS](https://goo.gl/maps/8y9XEjwQQgLkKrMJ9), higher secondary education from [AES](https://goo.gl/maps/eazASiYt1MGKvXTq7), and graduated from [JNU](https://www.jnu.ac.in/main/) as well as [IGNOU](http://www.ignou.ac.in/). 
  
  ü•á I am a MBA gold medalist from the [Pondicherry University](https://www.pondiuni.edu.in/). One of my MBA professors, [Dr Babu George](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beingbabu/), inspired me to realize the importance of own thoughts which eventually triggered my interest in research and teaching.
  
   My doctoral thesis [Handmade OK please: A Mixed Methods Study of Urban Indian Craft Consumers](http://14.139.116.20:8080/jspui/handle/10603/314484) was supervised by [Prof. Dr. B. Rajashekhar](https://profbrajashekhar.in/), School of Management Studies, University of Hyderabad, India. During my PhD, I was awarded DAAD student exchange fellowship for visiting and two months research stay at the ‚úàÔ∏è  [University of Wurzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/home/), Germany.
  
  For three years, I worked as an Assistant Professor in Pune. In 2022, for eight months I worked as the Head of School of Data Science & Information at the Nalanda Academy, Wardha. 
  
  In 2023, I founded ‚ù§Ô∏è Sara Institute of Data Science. I teach data science and research using R statistical language. Kindly check the website of my course [R for Beginners](https://r4b.netlify.app/). My dream is take data science education to under-represented students in India. As a data science teacher:
  
  - I don't  believe in memorizing the codes,
  - I think education and health-care should be free and fundamental rights of every citizen, and
  - I crack pathetic jokes during the teaching sessions. ü§™

  My research interests include sustainable production and consumption in context of discard studies. My recent research publication is:
  -  Koli, A.K. (2021), "Handmade OK please: key criteria for purchasing craft items by Indian consumers", *Journal of Cultural Heritage Management and Sustainable Development*, Vol. ahead-of-print No. ahead-of-print. https://doi.org/10.1108/JCHMSD-04-2020-0063
