  I was born on 24 January in a *Dalit* family from Haryana, India. I grew up with three sisters, mom and dad. 

  I earned my BA in Tourism Studies from [IGNOU](http://ignou.ac.in/), BA Hons Russian Studies from [JNU](https://www.jnu.ac.in/main/), MBA in Tourism (with Gold Medal) from [Pondicherry University](https://www.pondiuni.edu.in/) and PhD in Management Studies from the [University of Hyderabad](https://uohyd.ac.in/).  

  [Dr Babu George](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beingbabu/) - my MBA teacher & mentor - helped me to realise the importance of our thoughts. This triggered my interest in research and teaching. Thank you Babu sir!

  Most of my research work is from the perspective of sustainable consumption. My recent research interests include an interaction between sustainability and waste.
 
  I like to teach research methodology and data science using [R](https://www.r-project.org/). I focus more on understanding and interpretation of the concept than memorising it. My goal is to make learning research methods and data science less painful.
