description: Iâ€™m a first-generation university graduate. In Feb 2023, I founded the Savitribai Ramabai Institute of Data Science, also called as [Sara Institute](https://twitter.com/sara_institute). It is a non-profit organization. It aims to empower underrepresented communities using data science. I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) to teach data science. I am sincerely trying to make teaching and learning data science less painful. ðŸ™‚
